=== Suggestor ===
'''Last week done:'''
* extension created
* found out how to display data
* created table with feature combinations
* load test data into database
* load complet database dump
* there is no part of a dumps, there for rewrite/change importsrcript
** use api for parts of the data
** dump is in internal json representation

'''Feedback:'''  
* Modular development -> separation of suggester engine and connection to Wikidata
** suggester engine should be replaceable
* test some external suggester implementations
** departmental working
** closer look at the work from Nilesh Chakraborty
** comparison of some (external) suggestor implementations
* exact specification of the architecture and data structure
** live update of the data maybe not possible if suggester work on a extra database
* '''Goal''': working product! Connection to Wikidata is very important.

=== PubSubHubBub ===
'''Last week done:'''
* read specification of the protokoll
* considered reference project from google
* PubSubHubBub has 3 components; Hub, Subscriber, Publisher
** Hub, Subscriber exist
** Publisher exists, but must be integrated into the Mediawiki code
** Hub must be scalable
* started with an extension for the publisher component in MediaWiki.
* viewed at OHI-PMH
** bad code example
** use Wikidata for better code examples
* Google has a public Hub
** use to test our extension
** maybe it is possible to use a google hub for MediaWiki...

'''Feedback'''
* Is it possible to send more data to Hub or Subscriber? (except the URL)
* performance is very important
** dependence on external services is poor
** call must not block by external services
** use the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Job_queue| Job queue]

=== Access to Wikidata Labs ===
* apply formally
* public IPv4 addresses are rare

=== Documentation ===
* remains until further notice on github
* maybe problems with external feedback

=== Organizational ===
* next hangout next week
* personal meeting probably until next year 
** on the agenda next week
